God may be a judge, but I don't think He is going to measure every level of goodness.

The two work together with lots of good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show Ham as a fine actor, as well as a talented comedian.<br /><br />This story plays with some interesting themes, like Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG: here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. Or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off.\",\n          \"Woah! Is one thing I can say about this movie. Personally I'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie, but I loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end.<br /><br />I liked the movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause who played Charles Brady very very irresistible, I guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie.<br /><br />There was one thing that I was disappointed over. I've watched Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I don't know if it is because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more, that was the only disappointment in the movie but I guess it was made up for with Brian Krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the movie.<br /><br />If you are use to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie, he was nothing like angle boy. Although now that I think about it, it would be great to see Krause's character on Charmed taken over by evil making him something like his was in Sleepwalkers.<br /><br />I also have to say the music was GREAT in this movie too!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}],"source":["df.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0': 'review', df.columns[1]: 'sentiment'}, inplace=True)\n","df = df[['review', 'sentiment']]\n","display(df.head())"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"e41c4a7f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767279518446,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":216,"user":{"displayName":"R Lakshmi narayanan Surya","userId":"08491985308681423007"}},"outputId":"4ebd2152-f7b7-4a47-9525-2ba8676557d5"},"source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)\n","X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(df['cleaned_review'])\n","y = df['sentiment']\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","\n","print(f\"Shape of X_train: {X_train.shape}\")\n","print(f\"Shape of X_test: {X_test.shape}\")\n","print(f\"Shape of y_train: {y_train.shape}\")\n","print(f\"Shape of y_test: {y_test.shape}\")"],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Shape of X_train: (1276, 5000)\n","Shape of X_test: (320, 5000)\n","Shape of y_train: (1276,)\n","Shape of y_test: (320,)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"a5efd49a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767279365914,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":36976,"user":{"displayName":"R Lakshmi narayanan Surya","userId":"08491985308681423007"}},"outputId":"f2c4d3d8-4571-4f81-9d86-88281e90505f"},"source":["import re\n","import nltk\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n","try:\n","    stopwords.words('english')\n","except LookupError:\n","    nltk.download('stopwords')\n","\n","def preprocess_text(text):\n","    text = text.lower()\n","    text = re.sub(r'[^a-z\\s]', '', text)\n","    words = text.split()\n","    words = [word for word in words if word not in stopwords.words('english')]\n","    stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n","    words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]\n","\n","    return ' '.join(words)\n","df.loc[:, 'cleaned_review'] = df['review'].apply(preprocess_text)\n","display(df[['review', 'cleaned_review']].head())"],"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                                              review  \\\n","0  Little did I know that when I signed up the th...   \n","1  I'm getting a little tired of people misusing ...   \n","2  Woah!

The two work together with lots of good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show Ham as a fine actor, as well as a talented comedian.<br /><br />This story plays with some interesting themes, like Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG: here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. Or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off.\",\n          \"Woah! Is one thing I can say about this movie. Personally I'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie, but I loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end.<br /><br />I liked the movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause who played Charles Brady very very irresistible, I guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie.<br /><br />There was one thing that I was disappointed over. I've watched Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I don't know if it is because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more, that was the only disappointment in the movie but I guess it was made up for with Brian Krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the movie.<br /><br />If you are use to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie, he was nothing like angle boy. Although now that I think about it, it would be great to see Krause's character on Charmed taken over by evil making him something like his was in Sleepwalkers.<br /><br />I also have to say the music was GREAT in this movie too!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"im get littl tire peopl misus god name perpetu bigot view world well dont dismiss idea armageddon come antichrist dismiss idea certain peopl live truli good livesthey seem mostli white christian children go heaven rest us must suffer millenia hell earth werent good enough god may judg dont think go measur everi level good give creator credit\",\n          \"ye know rosco arbuckl didnt like call fatti couldnt resist jokebr br fine lloyd hamilton short peak period direct rosco two work togeth lot good gag rosco usual attent detail shoot pictur interest manner comedian prefer flat light still camera make interest rosco use coupl long track shot nice camera trickeri tell stori show ham fine actor well talent comedianbr br stori play interest theme like lloyd classic move along percept realiti confus movi make might choos ignor issu laugh head\",\n          \"woah one thing say movi person im one peopl love cat would big side movi love cat everi got reveng endbr br like movi admit found brian kraus play charl bradi irresist guess lust got better watch moviebr br one thing disappoint ive watch charm brian kraus marri holli mari comb kiss scene ok sleepwalk realli bad compar kiss scene holli mari comb dont know kraus comb great chemistri mayb bit disappoint movi guess made brian kraus tight ass jean wear moviebr br use see brian kraus holli mari comb heavenli husband father son big surpris movi noth like angl boy although think would great see kraus charact charm taken evil make someth like sleepwalkersbr br also say music great movi\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"726ed8ab","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767279403767,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":36285,"user":{"displayName":"R Lakshmi narayanan Surya","userId":"08491985308681423007"}},"outputId":"f16fc058-f38d-4b42-b4fa-6f22c7f913d9"},"source":["import re\n","import nltk\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n","try:\n","    stopwords.words('english')\n","except LookupError:\n","    nltk.download('stopwords')\n","\n","def preprocess_text(text):\n","    text = text.lower()\n","    text = re.sub(r'[^a-z\\s]', '', text)\n","    words = text.split()\n","    words = [word for word in words if word not in stopwords.words('english')]\n","    stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n","    words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]\n","\n","    return ' '.join(words)\n","df.loc[:, 'cleaned_review'] = df['review'].apply(preprocess_text)\n","display(df[['review', 'cleaned_review']].head())"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                                              review  \\\n","0  Little did I know that when I signed up the th...   \n","1  I'm getting a little tired of people misusing ...   \n","2  Woah!

The two work together with lots of good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show Ham as a fine actor, as well as a talented comedian.<br /><br />This story plays with some interesting themes, like Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG: here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. Or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off.\",\n          \"Woah! Is one thing I can say about this movie. Personally I'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie, but I loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end.<br /><br />I liked the movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause who played Charles Brady very very irresistible, I guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie.<br /><br />There was one thing that I was disappointed over. I've watched Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I don't know if it is because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more, that was the only disappointment in the movie but I guess it was made up for with Brian Krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the movie.<br /><br />If you are use to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie, he was nothing like angle boy. Although now that I think about it, it would be great to see Krause's character on Charmed taken over by evil making him something like his was in Sleepwalkers.<br /><br />I also have to say the music was GREAT in this movie too!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"im get littl tire peopl misus god name perpetu bigot view world well dont dismiss idea armageddon come antichrist dismiss idea certain peopl live truli good livesthey seem mostli white christian children go heaven rest us must suffer millenia hell earth werent good enough god may judg dont think go measur everi level good give creator credit\",\n          \"ye know rosco arbuckl didnt like call fatti couldnt resist jokebr br fine lloyd hamilton short peak period direct rosco two work togeth lot good gag rosco usual attent detail shoot pictur interest manner comedian prefer flat light still camera make interest rosco use coupl long track shot nice camera trickeri tell stori show ham fine actor well talent comedianbr br stori play interest theme like lloyd classic move along percept realiti confus movi make might choos ignor issu laugh head\",\n          \"woah one thing say movi person im one peopl love cat would big side movi love cat everi got reveng endbr br like movi admit found brian kraus play charl bradi irresist guess lust got better watch moviebr br one thing disappoint ive watch charm brian kraus marri holli mari comb kiss scene ok sleepwalk realli bad compar kiss scene holli mari comb dont know kraus comb great chemistri mayb bit disappoint movi guess made brian kraus tight ass jean wear moviebr br use see brian kraus holli mari comb heavenli husband father son big surpris movi noth like angl boy although think would great see kraus charact charm taken evil make someth like sleepwalkersbr br also say music great movi\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"d2541429","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767279108597,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":469,"user":{"displayName":"R Lakshmi narayanan Surya","userId":"08491985308681423007"}},"outputId":"0cc56567-912f-43b9-88a5-59c4902f65da"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv('/content/IMDB Dataset.csv', engine='python', encoding='utf-8', on_bad_lines='warn')\n","\n","display(df.head())"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/tmp/ipython-input-1149569929.py:4: ParserWarning: Skipping line 1598: unexpected end of data\n","\n","  df = pd.read_csv('/content/IMDB Dataset.csv', engine='python', encoding='utf-8', on_bad_lines='warn')\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                                          Unnamed: 0  \\\n","0  Little did I know that when I signed up the th...   \n","1  I'm getting a little tired of people misusing ...   \n","2  Woah!

The two work together with lots of good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show Ham as a fine actor, as well as a talented comedian.<br /><br />This story plays with some interesting themes, like Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG: here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. Or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off.\",\n          \"Woah! Is one thing I can say about this movie. Personally I'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie, but I loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end.<br /><br />I liked the movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause who played Charles Brady very very irresistible, I guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie.<br /><br />There was one thing that I was disappointed over. I've watched Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I don't know if it is because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more, that was the only disappointment in the movie but I guess it was made up for with Brian Krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the movie.<br /><br />If you are use to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie, he was nothing like angle boy. Although now that I think about it, it would be great to see Krause's character on Charmed taken over by evil making him something like his was in Sleepwalkers.<br /><br />I also have to say the music was GREAT in this movie too!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \" echoing some sort of psychotic persona more associated with Hannibal Lecter writing his letter's to Clarice in 2001's Hannibal.
